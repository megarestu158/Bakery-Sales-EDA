# Bakery-Sales-EDA

For a dessert lover, the bakery is one of their favorite places to visit. Inside the bakery, of course, many types of desserts were sold but not all were sold as expected. So, in this notebook, We will load, clea, and explore then seek insights in the data to design a bakery sales strategy using Python. The data used is bakery sales data in Edinburg starting from 30–10–2016 to 09–04–2017. It downloaded from Kaggle. Unfortunately, the existing data is not too much so it is not possible to do further exploration. The EDA that will be carried out on this project is as follows:

Which products are the top 10 best-selling and lowest of all time and each month?
How is the sales in each session (morning, afternoon, evening and night)?
How is the sales on weekdays and weekends?
